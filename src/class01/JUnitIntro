What is JUnit (Unit Testing Framework):
- library;
- testing methods (@Test);
- verify your code;
- unit testing;

Framework - set of rules:

Collections framework; Spring framework.

Features of Testing Framework?
* Validation;
* Better / Detailed Reporting;
* Documentation of the framework;
* Ability to group the tests under User Defined Category;
* Ability to pass parameters in the test;
* Data Driven Testing Facility;

Data Driven Testing - same test we execute for different data.

When we do DDT:
1. We need to clarify the requirements from (PO or BA), before assuming anything.

Class03Dec02_Revision JUnit:
@Test       -> makes the method "special", makes it a "test" method
@Before     -> pre-requisite("set up"): set up data-base connection
@After      -> clean-up("wrap-up"): close the Browser, close the DB(Data Base) Connection
@Category   -> categorise("group") our tests: Smoke tests, Regression tests, API tests

We have the Runner Class to execute a set of Test Cases.

Why Cucumber became successful?
